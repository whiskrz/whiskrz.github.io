  <h2>Twitter for Cats</h2>
  Our goal is to make the internet world more accessible and valuable to cats.
  We approach this through a <span>micro-blogging platform</span> that allows 
  felines to <span>interact and communicate</span> with each other.

  </div>
  <div class="feature">

  <h2>Easy to Use</h2>
  Our user experience experts have spent hours interacting with cats in their
  natural environments, and are prepared to create a blogging experience that
  <span>transcends such mundane details</span> as <em>typing</em> or <em>having
  fine motor skills</em> and allows our users to focus on what's really
  important: generating content, and staring lazily into space.

  <h2>High Demand</h2>
  When was the last time you read a blog by a cat? If you can't remember, you're
  not alone. Millions of cats are not on the internet yet, simply because there
  isn't a <span>tailored service</span> that works for them. Imagine, human,
  trying to use email for Rhinocerouses. The challenges you'd face are exactly
  what cats are trying to deal with when they go to publish now. We're going to
  lower that accessibility barrier.
